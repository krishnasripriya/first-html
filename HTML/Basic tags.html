    <p><b>Mother Teresa</b>, officially known as Saint Teresa of Calcutta, was a Roman Catholic nun and missionary who devoted her life to serving the poor and sick. She was born on August 26, 1910, in Skopje, which is now part of North Macedonia, and her birth name was AnjezÃ« Gonxhe Bojaxhiu. Her work with the poor in Calcutta, India, made her one of the most famous humanitarians of the 20th century.</p>
    <p>In 1946, Mother Teresa experienced what she described as a <u>"call within a call,"</u> where she felt  compelled by a "voice" to leave the convent and work with the poor.
    She received permission from the Vatican and founded the Missionaries of Charity in 1950.
    <em>The primary objective of this congregation was to care for,</em> in her own words, "the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone."</p>

    <p>Mother Teresa and her fellow sisters began by gathering children from the streets, <del>trending</del> tending to the sick and dying in the slums, and providing basic education. Over the years, the Missionaries of Charity grew into an international organization with thousands of members operating in more than 100 countries.<br/><br/>Their work expanded to include orphanages, schools, hospitals, and hospices for those with terminal illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, leprosy, and tuberculosis. Mother Teresa's dedication to the "poorest of the poor" garnered worldwide attention, and she became a symbol of selfless humanitarianism.</p><br>
    <h2>Mother Teresa: A Beacon of Light</h2>
    <pre><em><b>In the heart of Calcutta's bustling streets,
        Where poverty's grip never retreats,
        A figure in white, a beacon of light,
        Mother Teresa, shining ever so bright.</em></b></pre><br>
    <pre><em><b>With gentle hands and a compassionate gaze,
        She walked among the downtrodden, in humble ways.
        To the forgotten, the sick, and the poor,
        Her love knew no bounds, forever pure.</em></b></pre>
